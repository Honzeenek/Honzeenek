**`Website Engineer (Learning Code/Graphic Designer/Freelancer)`**

I'm a student focused on building my skills in web development, aiming for a career as a full-stack web developer. With a background in graphic design, I bring a strong visual perspective to my work, which I hope to leverage to create more visually appealing websites. My goal is to develop websites that are not only highly functional but also distinctively designed to stand out.

I’m passionate about creating custom, fully unique websites that add real value, especially in a landscape where many sites rely on WordPress templates, often lacking true customization and uniqueness. My mission is to craft visually compelling and original websites that elevate the browsing experience for users.
